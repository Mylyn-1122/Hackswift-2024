This is the hackathon project created by Mylyn and Siyou for hackswift 2024.

The global challenge we chose was food insecurity and hunger. The project takes data from the world hunger institute and displays it on a cloropleth map. Countries with a higher hunger index are colored in red. Users can click on a country, which will take them to a donation site to help. This allows users to see countries in trouble on a global scale and help those in need.

To run the program localy, use the "dist" folder. To run the original code created in codepen.io, use the src folder.
